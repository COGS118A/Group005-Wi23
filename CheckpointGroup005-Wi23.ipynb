    "The goal of this project is to predict whether a transaction is fraudulent given identity and transaction information. The data that we are using contains two files: identity and transaction, which are joined by the “TransactionID” variable. But not all transactions have corresponding identifiers. The variables in the identity dataset are network connection information and digital signature associated with transactions, which are provided by Vesta’s fraud protection system and digital security partners. The variables in the transaction dataset are transaction amounts, card information, product of each transaction, and other related information. We will first apply data cleaning, and then data engineering to One-Hot-Encode categorical variables, standardize numerical variables, and perform the PCA for newly engineered variables. Then, we will train different ML models on the top features. To evaluate the performance of our models, we will be using recall scores primarily since false negatives are more costly in fraud detection. We do not want to predict a transaction as normal when it is actually fraudulent. But we will also take precision, accuracy, and F1 score into consideration for the balance of our model predictions."

    "Fill in the background and discuss the kind of prior work that has gone on in this research area here. **Use inline citation** to specify which references support which statements.  You can do that through HTML footnotes (demonstrated here). I used to reccommend Markdown footnotes (google is your friend) because they are simpler but recently I have had some problems with them working for me whereas HTML ones always work so far. So use the method that works for you, but do use inline citations.\n",

    "Nowadays, electronic payments have become an indispensable part of people’s everyday lives. It is an ongoing trend that digital wallets have replaced physical wallets. But as this trend evolves, many unscrupulous people see the opportunity of making illegal profits out of it, i.e. through transaction fraud. Online transaction fraud occurs when a fraudster attempts to conduct a transaction using another person’s identity and payment information<a name=\"Sasso\"></a>[<sup>[1]</sup>](#Sasso). According to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), there was a total of 5.8 billion dollars of loss through fraud in 2021 for a 70 percent year-over-year increase<a name=\"Skiba\"></a>[<sup>[2]</sup>](#Skiba). In addition to ostensible monetary losses on the consumers’ sides, the fraud also induces negative impacts on customer/reputational, operational and topline revenue implications on the merchants’ sides<a name=\"McKee\"></a>[<sup>[3]</sup>](#McKee). If the merchants impose a restrictive fraud control policy, this can diminish the consumer experience. It is also time-consuming and labor-intensive for merchants to maintain anti-fraud technology. In terms of topline revenue, merchants may tend to avoid new revenue opportunities, such as entering a foreign market, due to concerns over fraud. Thus, it is of great importance to develop fraud detection algorithms to protect both consumers and merchants, and to provide a safe e-payment environment in general. In particular, machine learning techniques are widely used in fraud detection nowadays, and it is far more accurate than the traditional manual process. In the late 20th century, the companies spotted frauds through simple rules. For example, if a transaction exceeds 10,000 dollars, then there was a high risk of fraud. However, this was a static method since it could not keep up with the changing customer behavior promptly. That is, it was not effective in terms of adjusting to new fraud patterns. So, machine learning models are a better choice since it allows automation and self-adaptiveness. They learn which transactions are normal and which are anomalous<a name=\"Oakley\"></a>[<sup>[4]</sup>](#Oakley). However, a problem that we would encounter is the issue of imbalanced data. In the real world, most transactions are valid and only a small portion are fraud transactions<a name=\"Pykes\"></a>[<sup>[5]</sup>](#Pykes). Thus, we need to take this into account when we deal with our dataset."

Additionally, describe the problem thoroughly such that it is clear that the problem is quantifiable (the problem can be expressed in mathematical or logical terms), measurable (the problem can be measured by some metric and clearly observed), and replicable (the problem can be reproduced and occurs more than once).",
    "The problem is to predict whether a transaction is fraudulent using features such as card, address, email, device information, etc. Fraudulence is a big issue since it harms both customers and merchants, and the society in general. Historical methods of detecting fraud transactions were based on simple rules that may not be able to catch the complicated patterns in the data. The objective of this project is to predict if a transaction is fraudulent (label 1 means fraudulent, and label 0 means normal) through experimenting with different machine learning models and selecting the one with the highest recall score."
